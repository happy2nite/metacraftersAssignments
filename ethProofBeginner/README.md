**HAPPYCOIN**

**Description**

happyCoin is a Solidity contract for a token with the same name.

The contract has public variables that store the details about the token, such as its name, abbreviation, and total supply. 

It also has a mapping of addresses to balances, which keeps track of how many tokens each address holds.

The contract has two main functions: mint and burn.

The mint function takes an address and a value as parameters and increases the total supply of tokens by that amount.

It also increases the balance of the specified address by the same amount. 

The burn function works in the opposite way, destroying tokens by decreasing the total supply and the balance of the specified address by the given amount.

The burn function also has a conditional check to make sure that the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the amount being burned.

**Getting Started**

**Installing**

To use the happyCoin contract, you will need to have a Solidity development environment set up. 

This typically includes installing software such as Node.js, Truffle, and Ganache. 

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone this repository and install its dependencies by running npm install.

**Executing program**

To deploy the happyCoin contract to a local blockchain, you can use Truffle.

First, start Ganache to run a local blockchain. 

Then, in a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this project and run truffle migrate --reset. 

This will compile and deploy the contract to your local blockchain.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using Truffleâ€™s console. 

In a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this project and run truffle console.

This will open a JavaScript console where you can interact with the contract.

For example, to mint new tokens, you could run a command like this:

let instance = await happyCoin.deployed()
instance.mint(accounts[0], 100)

This will mint 100 new happyCoin tokens and assign them to the first account in Ganache.
